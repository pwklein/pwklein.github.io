Welcome to my page! I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist working in quantitative finance. I am a quantitative researcher at [One Eleven Capital](http://111cap.com).

My main interests in physics are centred around the mathematical exploration of a novel class of materials - so-called topological insulators and superconductors - that might play a crucial role in the development of a new generation of computing devices.
